## Requirements
This API works with mongoDB, so if you want to run this project in local you need to install mongoDB shell.

Also you need to have installed NodeJS.

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to install foobar.

```bash
npm install
```

with yarn

```bash
yarn install
```
For some reason, restify is not compatible with Nodejs v18, therefore you must run the execution commands with a minor version

NCR-SERVER has multiple endpoints that can be accessed.
